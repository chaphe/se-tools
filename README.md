# Practical Session: Debugging

Follow the instructions from the practical session page: [https://github.com/chaphe/se-tools](https://github.com/chaphe/se-tools)

## 1 - GDB Tutorial


Tutorial from [A GDB Tutorial with Examples](http://www.cprogramming.com/gdb.html)


## 2 - Valgrind Tutorial


Tutorial from [Using Valgrind to Find Memory Leaks and Invalid Memory Use](http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/valgrind.html)


 
## 3 - Bug Hunting

A list of programs demonstrating the different kind of bus are available in the `exercises` directory.
Try the different debugging tools on every example to see how they behave and find the bugs.

Run the following command to download all the exercises:
```
git clone https://github.com/chaphe/se-tools.git se-tools
```

### Notes:

  - You can compile each program manually using `gcc` or `icc`. You are encouraged to try both to see how differently they behave. Example: `gcc program.c -o program`. Add any additional parameter you might need.

  - Some program required additional options to be compiled. They are indicated in comment at the beginning of each source file.
